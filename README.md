# google_translator
Imports:

tkinter: Provides the graphical user interface (GUI) elements.
ttk: Offers themes and styles for GUI elements.
messagebox: Displays pop-up messages.
googletrans: Enables language translation using the Google Translate API.
textblob: Helps detect the source language of text.
PIL.ImageTk, PIL.Image: Allow displaying images in the GUI.
GUI Setup:

root: The main window of the application.
title: Sets the window title to "GOOGLE TRANSLATOR".
geometry: Defines the window size as 1080x400 pixels.
Functions:

label_change(): Dynamically updates the language labels ("ENGLISH") every second.
translate_now(again=None): Performs the translation when the "Translate" button is clicked:
Retrieves the text from text1.
Gets the selected source and target languages from combo1 and combo2.
Detects the source language using textblob.TextBlob.
Looks up the target language code in the language dictionary from googletrans.
Translates the text from the detected source language to the target language using textblob.translate.
Displays the translated text in text2.
Shows an error message if any exception occurs.
GUI Elements:

Background image ("background.png") is placed using a Label.
An arrow image ("arrow.png") is displayed between the languages.
Two ttk.Combobox elements (combo1, combo2) allow selecting the source and target languages.
Language labels ("ENGLISH") are updated by label_change.
Two Text widgets (text1, text2) hold the input and translated text, respectively.
Scrollbars are attached to both Text widgets for scrolling.
A "Translate" button triggers the translate_now function.
Overall Functionality:

The code creates a GUI-based language translator using Google Translate. Users can enter text in one language, select the source and target languages, and click "Translate" to see the translated text. While the explanation cannot be provided in an "entertaining" manner, I hope this technical breakdown is helpful!
